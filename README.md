    Projects of USI master's in Finance.
    The progetto_finale file is a project of the first semester, i'll show you the test of the project: 
    Option pricing using different techniques:
        Compare the performance of option pricing with Monte Carlo simulation of a geometric Brownian
        motion and with a binary tree. To get a realistic input value for the volatility, estimate it from
        (a) historical stock data or (b) from option prices. Take data for some stock from yahoo or any
        other source. Indicate clearly in the documentation which date and which underlying you use.
        Include the code and the data for the estimation of the implied volatility in your project.
        Price a plain vanilla European option, produce the Greeks and least two of the following
        options: Corridor, knock-in, knock-out, American, Asian, digital option, Bermuda, Quanto. Try
        to price an American digital option. Discuss the results.
        Note: not all options can be priced equally well with a Monte Carlo and a binary tree. Briefly
        discuss why in your report.
